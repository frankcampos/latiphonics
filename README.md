The Problem
As a Spanish speaker, one of the most difficult things about pronunciation is the vowels and their combinations. English has more than five different pronunciations for them.


## The Solution <!-- OPTIONAL, but doesn't hurt -->



## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
1. As a Spanish speaker, I want to view the IPA symbols for each vowel so that I can learn the correct representation of individual vowel sounds.
1. As a Spanish speaker, I want to see example phrases with IPA transcriptions so that I can understand how the individual sounds are used in context.
1. As a Spanish speaker, I want to add my own notes to symbols and phrases so that I can customize my learning experience according to my needs.
